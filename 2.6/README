to do list for prob_bulge.f

-> characterize and correct input files on .f code
   -> "2768_complete_clean_dec.dat" is the spec catalog 
   -> ffile is ok
   -> input is ok 
   -> table.dat is already on 2.5 folder
	
   -> "bin_2768.dat" is bin_.dat 
   -> "likelihood_2768.dat" is like_.dat 	

   -> "unliky.dat" is an output file (the main one)
   -> "all.dat" is not used anywhere
   -> "for_lodo.dat" is an output file
   -> "bin_vp.dat" is an output file

   -> "bin_rej.dat" I don't know where this comes from, is this rejected.dat? from sigma clipping?	

-> on line 147 ra*3600, not sure about this, it's different from ML.f



-> reading the output:
   -> structure of unliky.dat:
# ra dec x y ysi vel fb bb bd gi likes sg sz comp bin i

   - fb is our f
   - bb is likelihood of being in the spheroid
   - bd is likelihood of being in the disk
   - likes is overall likelihood
   - sg and sz are set to be 0.0 forever
   - comp is always 0.0 too;
   - bin is 0
   - i is
